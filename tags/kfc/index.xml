      <description>Supper with my dear friend Jamie Scott can often be a bit of a chore. Although his company is a delight, sharing food with him is a challenge because he is a selfish and greedy little prick. This was not a concern when between us was KFC’s masterful Deluxe Boneless Feast. I knew that however much dear Jamie clawed and grabbed at the box, which was supposed to be in our common ownership, there was no way we wouldn’t both be leaving the restaurant very full up indeed.</description>
