&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-blog&#34;&gt;New Blog!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where better to start a new blog than a blog post about how I made this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last Christmas holidays I have started playing around with the Go programming languages. Wow! What a great
programming language! At work I mainly wrote Java code, and at University I mainly use C. Go seems to combine a lot of
the positive aspects of both. It also has a very interesting and neat model for writing parallel or concurrent programs.
I hope to write a blog about this soon as I have been working on porting some OpenMP code over to Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show all this off I thought I had better make a personal website. I already had already set up a github pages repo
and just needed some pages to fill it. I am not a big fan of (or very good at) doing web development or building GUIs of
any sort, so wanted some way of automating this process. I read about Hugo, which is a static web generator built in Go,
and it seemed to be a good fit for what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-hugo&#34;&gt;Installing Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with Go so I decided to install Hugo from sources, with a hope to maybe poking around in the source
code at some point.
With Go installed and a GOPATH environment variable set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd $GOPATH/src &amp;amp;&amp;amp; go get -v github.com/spf13/hugo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will cd to your go src dir and download all of the hugo source code, as well as its dependendencies, then compile it
all. If you have $GOPATH/bin added to your $PATH then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugo help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
